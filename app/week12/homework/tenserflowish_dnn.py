"""
     You need to do the same implementation of the previous homework but with tensorflow. However, you cannot use dense
     layer or dense network implementations of tf or keras. Here are some notes
     - you can use all tf basic mathematical operations (matmul, mean or calculations etc.)
     - you can use tf.GradientTape() to calculate gradients of the loss function
     - you can use tf.Module and inherit your dense layer and dense network from it. Therefore, you can use all the
       methods and arguments that the tf.Module includes (e.g, .trainable_variables)
     - you cannot use anything else, that is connected to dense or any other layer implementation from tf
       (e.g., tf.keras.layers.Dense)
     - if you want to use anything else from tf, ask me, maybe I forgot to add something in this list
